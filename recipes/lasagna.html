    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that embodies layers of flavor, texture, and heartwarming comfort 
        At its core, lasagna is a baked casserole featuring sheets of pasta interspersed with rich, savory fillings 
        Traditional lasagna often starts with a hearty meat sauce, such as a slow-simmered Bolognese, 
        layered with creamy ricotta cheese mixed with herbs, gooey melted mozzarella, and a dusting of nutty Parmesan 
        Each bite offers a perfect harmony of tender pasta, flavorful sauce, and indulgent cheese, 
        creating a symphony of taste that's both satisfying and deeply comforting</p>
    
    <p>Beyond its classic form, lasagna is incredibly versatile and can cater to various dietary preferences 
        Vegetable lasagnas replace meat with roasted zucchini, spinach, or eggplant, often paired with a tangy tomato sauce or velvety béchamel 
        Meanwhile, modern twists might include layers of pesto, seafood, or even a plant-based filling for a lighter yet equally delicious experience 
        Its golden, bubbling crust and fragrant aroma make lasagna a centerpiece for family gatherings or casual weeknight dinners, 
        delivering a sense of home with every serving</p>
